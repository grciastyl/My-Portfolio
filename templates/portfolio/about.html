        <h2>My Role as a Developer</h2>
        <h2>Christopher Garcia</h2>
        <p>I am a fledgling developer soon completing San Diego Global Knowledge Universityâ€™s Full Stack Development
            Immersive Program. My training covers both front-end and back-end development, giving me a well-rounded
            skill set for building complete web applications.
            <br>
            I enjoy the creativity of front-end development, where I can design interfaces that are both visually
            appealing and functional. On the back end, I value the opportunity to apply problem-solving and logical
            thinking to create efficient, reliable systems.
            <br>
            I am passionate about learning, improving my craft, and contributing to projects that combine clean design,
            functionality, and innovation.
